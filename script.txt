Where am I?
I suddenly woke up in an unfamiliar place.
Well, not entirely unfamiliar, I guess.
I was in a jail cell.
For a regular person, that might be a jarring place to wake up in.
For me, the weird thing was that it wasn't my usual jail cell.
I noticed a piece of paper on the ground. A note.
I picked it up and started reading.
!command: note1
!command: note2
What the hell?
There's no way this is for real.
A chance at freedom? Way too good to be true.
But "forfeiting your life"...
I didn't even want to think about that.
Who was doing this? And why?
...
I sat around in anticipation.
...
The minutes became hours.
...
.....
.......
!command: sound buzzer
..!
The loud buzzer shook me awake.
It was followed by a booming voice on the loudspeaker.
*THE GAME WILL NOW BEGIN.*
Suddenly, the jail cell's door swung open.
*PLEASE PROCEED DOWN THE HALLWAY.*
It was time for the game to start.
I left the cell and walked down the long hallway.
I eventually got to a door with a sign that read: "Prep room".
I took a deep breath and walked in, unsure of what was to come.
!command: end
