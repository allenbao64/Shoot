...
Wha-?
(I suddenly woke up in an unfamiliar place.)
???: I see you've woken up.
What...where am I? Who are you?
???: You don't remember either, huh?
...
???: You were probably a prisoner, just like me.
...
How did you...know that?
???: It seems they've brought a bunch of us here,
???: to play some kind of game.
Game?
???: One of them explained the gist of the game to me.
???: Then he told me to pass on the info to you.
Okay...
???: So apparently we're in a tournament called Shoot.
???: It's basically Rock-Paper-Scissors with modifiers.
???: We'll each be given 5 cards to use in a rotation.
???: And each has its own effects that can change the game.
(While he was explaining, I couldn't help but notice...)
(I had this weird tablet on me. The other guy had one too.)
(Didn't seem like it was gonna turn on though.)
Sounds simple enough.
???: That's not the interesting part though.
I don't like the sound of that.
???: I'm not sure if they're serious about this part, but...
...
???: They said the loser of each round was...
???: To be executed.
...What?!
Like...killed?
???: That's what they said.
That's insane! There's no way that's for real!
???: I sure hope so.
(Suddenly, our tablets lit up.)
*FIRST ROUND STARTS IN 1 MINUTE*
(We both said nothing.)
(This was too weird. Too crazy.)
(We sat in anticipation for the longest 60 seconds of my life.)
(Suddenly, I heard footsteps. A guard.)
Guard: It's time. Move it.
(My tablet lit up again.)
*ROUND ONE OPPONENT: ALEX*
It says my opponent is someone named Alex.
???: ...
Uh...
???: ...
You okay?
???: So this is how it's gonna be, huh...
What?
???: Nice to meet you. The name's Alex.
(Before I could react, the guards pulled us away.)
(It was time for the game to start.)
